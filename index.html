<p>This debate was very interesting and the students had very clever ideas based on the topic of Environment Pollution. Our debating coach did a very good job in guiding the students in the Debate Group to try their very best, work hard to achieve something and think of very good topics to speak about in the debate in order to support their argument.</p>

    <p>We are very proud of our students for winning second place in this competition. Students were given time to work on their projects at home and at school. This year there was no specific theme for the projects and we had lots of wonderful submissions. Everyone was gifted with a participation medal to show how we appreciate the students efforts at our school. We encourage students to use their creativity and create some truly spectacular.</p>

    <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

      Considering the food options and responsibilities, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their history of meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss fo handling money making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy - 
    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimise the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
    <br>
    2. Economics - Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to innacurate time reporting
